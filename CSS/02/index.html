    <br />
    <h3>Size</h3>
    <p>
      The domestic cat has a smaller skull and shorter bones than the European wildcat.
      <sup>[49]</sup> It averages about 46 cm (18 in) in head-to-body length and 23–25 cm
      (9.1–9.8 in) in height, with about 30 cm (12 in) long tails. Males are larger than
      females.<sup>[50]</sup> Adult domestic cats typically weigh 4–5 kg (8.8–11.0
      lb).<sup>[29]</sup>
    </p>
    <h3>Skeleton</h3>
    <p>
      Cats have seven cervical vertebrae (as do most mammals); 13 thoracic vertebrae
      (humans have 12); seven lumbar vertebrae (humans have five); three sacral vertebrae
      (as do most mammals, but humans have five); and a variable number of caudal
      vertebrae in the tail (humans have only three to five vestigial caudal vertebrae,
      fused into an internal coccyx).<sup>[51]: 11</sup>  The extra lumbar and thoracic
      vertebrae account for the cat's spinal mobility and flexibility. Attached to the
      spine are 13 ribs, the shoulder, and the pelvis.<sup>[51]: 16</sup> Unlike human
      arms, cat forelimbs are attached to the shoulder by free-floating clavicle bones
      which allow them to pass their body through any space into which they can fit their
      head.<sup>[52]</sup>
    </p>
    <h3>Scull</h3>
    <p>
      The cat skull is unusual among mammals in having very large eye sockets and a
      powerful specialized jaw.<sup>[53]: 35</sup>Within the jaw, cats have teeth adapted
      for killing prey and tearing meat. When it overpowers its prey, a cat delivers a
      lethal neck bite with its two long canine teeth, inserting them between two of the
      prey's vertebrae and severing its spinal cord, causing irreversible paralysis and
      death.<sup>[54]</sup> Compared to other felines, domestic cats have narrowly spaced
      canine teeth relative to the size of their jaw, which is an adaptation to their
      preferred prey of small rodents, which have small vertebrae.<sup>[54]</sup>

      The premolar and first molar together compose the carnassial pair on each side of
      the mouth, which efficiently shears meat into small pieces, like a pair of scissors.
      These are vital in feeding, since cats' small molars cannot chew food effectively,
      and cats are largely incapable of mastication.<sup>[53]: 37</sup> Cats tend to have
      better teeth than most humans, with decay generally less likely because of a thicker
      protective layer of enamel, a less damaging saliva, less retention of food particles
      between teeth, and a diet mostly devoid of sugar. Nonetheless, they are subject to
      occasional tooth loss and infection.<sup>[54]</sup>
    </p>
    <h3>Claws</h3>
    <p>
      Cats have protractible and retractable claws.<sup>[56]</sup> In their normal,
      relaxed position, the claws are sheathed with the skin and fur around the paw's toe
      pads. This keeps the claws sharp by preventing wear from contact with the ground and
      allows for the silent stalking of prey. The claws on the forefeet are typically
      sharper than those on the hindfeet.<sup>[57]</sup> Cats can voluntarily extend their
      claws on one or more paws. They may extend their claws in hunting or self-defense,
      climbing, kneading, or for extra traction on soft surfaces. Cats shed the outside
      layer of their claw sheaths when scratching rough surfaces.<sup>[58]</sup>

      Most cats have five claws on their front paws and four on their rear paws. The
      dewclaw is proximal to the other claws. More proximally is a protrusion which
      appears to be a sixth "finger". This special feature of the front paws on the inside
      of the wrists has no function in normal walking but is thought to be an antiskidding
      device used while jumping. Some cat breeds are prone to having extra digits
      ("polydactyly"). Polydactylous cats occur along North America's northeast coast and
      in Great Britain.<sup>[60]</sup>
    </p>
    <h3>Ambulation</h3>
    <p>
      The cat is digitigrade. It walks on the toes, with the bones of the feet making up
      the lower part of the visible leg.<sup>[61]</sup> Unlike most mammals, it uses a
      "pacing" gait and moves both legs on one side of the body before the legs on the
      other side. It registers directly by placing each hind paw close to the track of the
      corresponding fore paw, minimizing noise and visible tracks. This also provides sure
      footing for hind paws when navigating rough terrain. As it speeds up from walking to
      trotting, its gait changes to a "diagonal" gait: The diagonally opposite hind and
      fore legs move simultaneously.<sup>[62]</sup>
    </p>
    <h3>Balance</h3>
    <p>
      Cats are generally fond of sitting in high places or perching. A higher place may
      serve as a concealed site from which to hunt; domestic cats strike prey by pouncing
      from a perch such as a tree branch. Another possible explanation is that height
      gives the cat a better observation point, allowing it to survey its territory. A cat
      falling from heights of up to 3 m (9.8 ft) can right itself and land on its
      paws.<sup>[63]</sup>

      During a fall from a high place, a cat reflexively twists its body and rights itself
      to land on its feet using its acute sense of balance and flexibility. This reflex is
      known as the cat righting reflex.<sup>[64]</sup> A cat always rights itself in the
      same way during a fall, if it has enough time to do so, which is the case in falls
      of 90 cm (3.0 ft) or more.<sup>[65]</sup> How cats are able to right themselves when
      falling has been investigated as the "falling cat problem".<sup>[66]</sup>

    <h3>Coats</h3>

    </p>
    <p>
      The cat family (Felidae) can pass down many colors and patterns to their offspring.
      The domestic cat genes MC1R and ASIP allow color variety in their coats. The feline
      ASIP gene consists of three coding exons.<sup>[67]</sup> Three novel microsatellite
      markers linked to ASIP were isolated from a domestic cat BAC clone containing this
      gene to perform linkage analysis on 89 domestic cats segregated for melanism. The
      domestic cat family demonstrated a cosegregation between the ASIP allele and coat
      black coloration.<sup>[68]</sup>
